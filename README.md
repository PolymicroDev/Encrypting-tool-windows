# Encrypting-tool-windows
An encryptor tool with an interactive windows form. It is able to encrypt every existing file

Requirements, tools that need to be installed:
- Windows OS
- Python -> pip installer -> cryptography library

Guide:
- In the first text-box input the path of the folder containing the tool.
- In the second text-box input the path of the folder in which you intend to encrypt the files.

Cautions:
- Do NOT run the encryptor multiple times in a row, because the key will be overridden each time!
(e.g: you could only revert the second encryption to the first encryption state with the key being overridden)

I am not taking any responsibility for improper utilization.
